## Personal Information

I was born in Colombia in 1996 and grew up in Miami. For my undergrad, I studied Law at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota. During the program, I worked part-time as a paralegal at Holland & Knight for about 3 years. I graduated in 2020 and continued to work for the same firm for about a year, before I had a brief stint working as a lawyer for Mercadolibre (essentially the Latin American Amazon). I left Mercadolibre because I decided it was time to make a change. My time as a lawyer was very rewarding and allowed me to gain experience in solving problems for a vast array of companies in different industries. However, as we have seen recently with advancements in artificial intelligence and the rise of tools such as ChatGPT, people who are knowledgeable and skilled in data are becoming increasingly important to companies, and I believe that this importance will only increase in the upcoming decades.

I am highly interested in solving complex business problems by leveraging the power of data to drive informed decisions and strategy. This is why I decided to pursue my master's degree in Management & Systems with a concentration in database technologies at NYU, where I will graduate in May of 2023. I have taken classes such as Database Design & Management, Data Mining & Warehousing, and Database Technologies for Web Applications. This has allowed me to gain significant experience in SQL, Python, R, HTML, JavaScript, and Tableau. During this program I have also had the opportunity of working as a Data Analyst for the NYU Stern School of Business where I have been in charge of collecting, processing, and analyzing student data.
