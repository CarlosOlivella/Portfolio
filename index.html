    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is Carlos Olivella. This is the repository I have created to showcase my portfolio. You will find projects relating to data analysis, data science, and data engineering. Feel free to look around.</p>

    <h2>Google Data Analysis Certificate Program</h2>
    <p>This is the repository I have created for the Capstone Project I carried out within the Data Analytics Google Certificate offered on Coursera. Here's some information about the project:
    <p><b>Project Title:</b> Analysis of smart device fitness data for Bellabeat</p>
    <p><b>Project Description:</b> This project is part of the final capstone project offered by Google within the Data Analytics certificate program offered on Coursera. Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of heath-focused products for women that provide users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. The marketing analytics team at Bellabeat has been assigned the task of analyzing smart device fitness data to identify connections, themes, and patterns and provide Bellabeat executive team with useful insights into how consumers are using Bellabeat products and, in turn, help guide the company's marketing strategy to unlock new growth opportunities.</p>
